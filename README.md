> Money tracker web app

*This web-app is deployed through Heroku -> [KKB](kkb-app.herokuapp.com)*

I was inspired to start this project to practise MERN stack development, and also allow people to manage their finances in a simple and aesthetically pleasing way. Some key features of this web app include: account creation, user authentication, adding & removing income and expense records, fixed income and expenses to reduce unnecessary repetition, and a total balance overview.
